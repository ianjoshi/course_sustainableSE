summary: |-
  This study evaluates the energy efficiency of RegEx engines across JavaScript, Java, .NET, and C++. It analyses their performance at varying complexity levels. Results show that JavaScript consistently consumes the least energy, Java exhibits the highest consumption for low and medium complexity patterns, and .NET and C++ spend the most amount of energy on highly complex patterns. Statistical analysis confirms significant differences, which emphasises the importance of optimizing RegEx usage. Given the increasing focus on sustainable software engineering, developers should consider energy-efficient engines and optimization strategies to mitigate negative environmental impact
